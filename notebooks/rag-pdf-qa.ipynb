    "# Simple RAG pipeline allowing you to \"talk\" to your documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a simple application for using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to \"ask questions\" from a PDF, using a powerful package called `langchain`. In this case, we're going to use a PDF of the PyCharm documentation, but `langchain` allows you to use a [wide variety of input formats](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/), giving you significant flexibility over your input data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pipeline, we'll need to do the following:\n",
    "* Load in (for local models) or connect to the API of (for remote models) our LLM;\n",
    "* Load in our PDF that we want to \"chat\" to;\n",
    "* We can't pass the whole PDF into a model at the same time (it's almost 2000 pages!). As such, we need to split it into chunks;\n",
    "* Rather than needing to pass every individual chunk through the LLM to find the information in the document relevant to a question, we can convert these chunks into document embeddings, which we then store in a vector database. At query time, the question is also converted into a document embedding, and the most similar document chunks to the question are retrieved."

    "## Levers in the RAG pipeline\n",
    "RAG is quite tricky to get right, especially if you need it to be efficient. There are many levers we can pull in our pipeline, which influence the following things:\n",
    "* How fast we can get our answers;\n",
    "* How relevant our answers are (and related, how likely we are to get a hallucination);\n",
    "* How complete our answers are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's instantiate our PDF questioner with the following values:\n",
    "* `model`: the LLM used to generate answers using information from the document. In this case, `gpt-3.5-turbo`.\n",
    "* `pdf_document`: the PDF we want to \"chat with\". In our case, we've selected our PDF containing almost all of the PyCharm documentation.\n",
    "* `chunk_size`: the maximum number of tokens to include in each chunk. We've selected 1000.\n",
    "* `chunk_overlap`: the number of tokens that should overlap between adjacent chunks. We've selected 0, so no overlapping tokens.\n",
    "* `search_type`: the metric by which chunks are selected. In this case, we've selected \"similarity\", so those chunks with the highest (cosine) similarity to the content of the question we're asking. However, you can also use \"mmr\" (if supported by your document store) which tries to maximise for relevancy and diversity of results.\n",
    "* `n_documents`: the maximum number of chunks to use to generate the answer. In this case, we've used 5.\n",
    "* `chain_type`: this controls how the content is passed into the LLM. In the case of \"stuff\" it passes all gathered context chunks into the context window at once. Other options are \"refine\", which feeds in the chunks in batches, plus the answer generated so far, and \"map-rerank\", which feeds in each chunk and assigns a score based on how well it answered the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other levers I've chosen not to make arguments in this class are the model used for embeddings (the `OpenAIEmbeddings` were used) and which vector database we use to store the document embeddings (in this case, the `Chroma` vector store was used)."
